# NASACodziennaFotka
Shows an actual NASA foto from their RSS channel

This is my first Android application suitable for smartphones operating with Android OS. 
I've built it with Android 6 OS called Marshmallow.
The app presents NASA image of the day with short description underneath. I've written this app to learn Java.
I've been interested how to utilize a parser and get familiar with Android programming.
